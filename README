= dspawn (Daemon Spawn)

https://github.com/bertjwregeer/dspawn

== DESCRIPTION

Small application that spawns and manages daemons based upon files in a
directory structure. Compare this to [Dan J. Bernstein][1]'s [daemontools][2].
There are some small differences, instead of having to create new directories
for the same program to run again with the same parameters you can simply ask
dspawn to run the same program multiple times (parallel processes for example).

== REQUIREMENTS

 Building:

  - scons

 Running:

  - libev
